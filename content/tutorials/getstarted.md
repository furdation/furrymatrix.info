## Getting Started

For a first time user, it is generally recommended to use Element in a web browser as it is the simplest to use.

Before anything else, you need to first choose a homserver on which your account will live, kind of like an e-mail
provider. You can find a good list of furry-friendly and furry-run homeservers on [the main page]({{< ref "/_index.md#furry-homeservers" >}}), and pick one with open registrations.
