Matrix is an open federated instant messaging protocol originally created in 2014.  
This means that just like with e-mail, anybody on a Matrix server can talk to any user on another server.  
As Matrix is an open protocol, anybody is welcome to make clients, bots, servers and any software really.  
Most software in the ecosystem is Open-Source with some rare exceptions.

You can learn more about Matrix on [their official website](https://matrix.org).
